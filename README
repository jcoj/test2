** Running pipeline from Jenkinsfile **

When Jenksfile is in the repo, all we have to do is to open the pipeline configuration and in the pipeline section:

* Change definition from pipeline script to pipeline script from SCM
* Select git in SCM
* Put https://github.com/beerkeeper/python-ip-script.git

After saving, the build will always run from the current version of Jenkinsfile into the repository. 

For the python script run sucessfully you must install.
pip install requests==2.16.5
